# Optional Folder: Read Only If You Have Mentioned These Skills in Your Resume

This folder contains additional resources that you may find helpful, especially if you have listed these skills on your resume.

## JS Fundamentals (CORE Concepts) Notes

The notes in this folder are my handwritten summaries, created while referring to the playlist [Namaste JS by Akshay Saini](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxnjbfm5MCHFbRlyVCAqpJFdIzPN_IPID&si=pFjnkDZP2CDqe-nX). You can use these notes for last-minute revision.

If you're interested, I've also written a blog post on this topic: [Get Your Fundamentals Right - JavaScript Edition](https://shivkaraman.hashnode.dev/get-your-fundamentals-right-javascript-edition).


If you have done anything else like Node.js or express etc. Make sure you know the core concepts of that tech stack(Internal Working).

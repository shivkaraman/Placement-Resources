# Placement Resources

-   **DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS IS MANDATORY IN ANY INTERVIEW PREPARATION**
-   Everybody has to read **CORE + C and C++ fundamentals (If your coding language is C++)**
-   CN and OS most important followed by OOPS and then DBMS (almost all companies)
-   INTER PREP = DS + CORE + PROJECTS + BASIC SYSTEM DESIGN

## DSA

Every data structure is important, and you can't predict what is asked. Know each data structure very well and solve a decent amount of questions on each data structure.

Tips:

-   For the coding round, almost all companies will ask questions in this fashion (1-2 graph/tree questions + 1 array or string question). So make sure you solve all varieties of graph and tree questions.
-   DSA questions asked during the interviews are not that difficult (between LeetCode easy-medium). Interviewers in most cases ask questions on Linked List (most favorite ds for interviewers that visit our campus) and other linear data structures. They can also ask basic questions on non-linear data structures as well (like BFS, DFS, height of a binary tree, diameter of a binary tree, etc.)
-   If you are attending interviews of CTC > 15 LPA, it is better to prepare well on both linear and non-linear data structures.

## C & C++

1. **C**

    - Pointers are very important.
    - Storage classes in C is one question that is asked in almost every interview if questions are asked on C.
    - Structure vs enum vs union.
    - I recommend you to completely read the C fundamentals notes.

2. **C++**
    - Reference Variables.
    - Inline Functions.
    - What are templates (with code example) and STL - Refer STL section in my C++ Fundamentals notes.
    - Know the time complexity of functions of each ds and also internal implementation of Data structures.
    - OOPS.

## Core

1. **CN (Computer Networks)**

    - OSI layers - Each layer complete understanding.
    - TCP vs UDP.
    - FTP protocol.
    - Watch a video for any topic you don't understand.

2. **OS (Operating System)**

    - Process Synchronization - Critical section and semaphores.
    - Deadlocks - Complete chapter in my notes.
    - Memory management and virtual memory complete.

3. **OOPS**

    - Inheritance and Polymorphism.
    - Virtual functions, Virtual Constructor and Virtual Destructor, Virtual Base Class -> VVVVVIP Pakka question in any interview.

    Now OOPS is something that is really important and very deep. But it completely depends on the interviewer if he asks questions on OOPS or not, If they do so they will go really deep so prepare very well for OOPS (including code: syntax for everything).

    Refer OOPS in C++ by Balaguruswamy book for OOPS (Only Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism chapters are enough) and My notes to revise.
    Also, refer to the playlist: [OOPS in C++ Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agpFUAlPFe_VNSlXW5uE0YL). This playlist is created based on the above mentioned book.

4. **DBMS**
    - DBMS is NOT asked in a lot of interviews. Read it at the end when you are done with all other subjects. SQL queries are the most important part in DBMS.

## System Design

This is something that the interviewer will not expect much from you. But you must have at least a basic understanding of it. You should be in a position to at least give some answer instead of saying I don't Know. Refer to the pdf that I have in the root folder.
